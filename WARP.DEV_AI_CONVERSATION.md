Plan: Implement Google Analytics 4 (GA4) integration across the Next.js Pages Router app with production-only loading, IP anonymization, and Consent Mode v2. Add SPA pageview tracking, instrument gameplay/result events, and update documentation and versioning per project rules.

Decisions:
- Single GA property across all orgs
- Production-only load (NODE_ENV=production)
- IP anonymization enabled on all hits
- Consent Mode v2 defaults to denied; expose `window.NARIMATO_setAnalyticsConsent(granted)` helper
- Custom events: `play_start`, `swipe_action`, `vote_cast`, `segment_end`, `play_complete`, `results_view`

Changes:
- Created `lib/analytics/ga.js` (helpers with production guards, consent helpers)
- Added `pages/_app.js` (loads gtag, initializes Consent Mode, tracks SPA pageviews)
- Instrumented `pages/play.js` and `pages/results.js` with custom events
- Updated package.json versions (5.5.1 → build verification → 5.6.0)
- Updated README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, TASKLIST.md, ROADMAP.md, LEARNINGS.md, RELEASE_NOTES.md (ISO 8601 timestamps)

CSP Guidance:
- script-src: https://www.googletagmanager.com https://www.google-analytics.com
- connect/img-src: https://www.google-analytics.com

Next steps:
- Add consent UI (cookie banner) wiring to `window.NARIMATO_setAnalyticsConsent`
- Configure Vercel Production env var: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-8RCT54Y6E7`
- Optional: BigQuery export for raw event analysis

# Update — 2025-09-07T08:45:15.000Z
- Author: Agent Mode (AI)
- Plan: Implement Rank-More mode (hierarchical decision-tree ranking)
- Details:
  - Multi-pass orchestration that runs Rank-Only per family; families processed in random order within each level
  - Branch exclusion: disliked children remove their entire branch from consideration
  - Output: flattened list only (parent followed by ranked descendants)
  - Reuse: SwipeOnlyEngine, RankOnlyEngine, VoteOnlyService, PlayDispatcher, unified /api/v1/play endpoints
- Next Steps:
  - Create RankMorePlay model and RankMoreEngine orchestrator
  - Register mode='rank_more' in PlayDispatcher; extend /api/v1/play/start to accept the mode
  - Ensure unified input/results support; frontend prompts for family-by-family flows (no breadcrumbs)
  - Update ROADMAP.md, TASKLIST.md and follow versioning rules
- Timestamps: ISO 8601 with millisecond precision (UTC)

# Update — 2025-09-07T11:34:45.000Z
- Author: Agent Mode (AI)
- Minor Release: v6.4.0 — New Play Mode: Rank-More
- Backend: Added RankMoreEngine and RankMorePlay; integrated with PlayDispatcher; extended start mode list; unified input/next/results; fixed hierarchical level progression logic
- Frontend: Added Rank More button; fixed swipe payload shape; added returnToSwipe handling to jump into new families; subtle “new-level” transition
- Docs: Updated README, API_REFERENCE, ARCHITECTURE, WARP.md, TASKLIST, ROADMAP, LEARNINGS, RELEASE_NOTES; all timestamps ISO 8601 with milliseconds
- Notes: Families are processed in random order within each level; branch exclusion for disliked children; results flattened only

# Update — 2025-09-07T12:10:54.000Z
- Author: Agent Mode (AI)
- Minor Release: v6.5.0 — Unified Canonical Documentation
- Actions:
  - Rewrote narimato_unified_documentation_UPDATED.md as the canonical engineering spec (replacing legacy session‑based content)
  - Propagated version bump to 6.5.0 across package.json, README.md (badge/current), ARCHITECTURE.md (Current Version, Last Updated), ROADMAP.md (Current Version, Last Updated), TASKLIST.md (Current Version, Date, Last Updated), RELEASE_NOTES.md (new entry v6.5.0), docs/API_REFERENCE.md (header + Last Updated + deprecation note)
  - Resolved API reference contradiction: clarified that specialized vote‑only endpoints under /api/v1/play/vote-only/* REMAIN for backward compatibility but are DEPRECATED internally; new work must use unified /api/v1/play/*
- Verification: Documentation‑only changes; build verification pending on request
- Notes: No code logic changes; aligns with WARP.md rules (no tests, no breadcrumbs, Atlas‑only, field constants) and ISO 8601 ms timestamps

- Verification: Build executed next

# Update — 2025-09-10T11:29:27.000Z
- Author: Agent Mode (AI)
- Patch Release: v6.11.2 — Deck-Specific Onboarding Pairing
- Changes:
  - Play page: computeOnboardingQueue now pairs only the onboarding parent whose base name matches the selected deck base (strip #, toLowerCase, remove suffix “_onboarding”/“-onboarding”/” onboarding”).
  - Ensures “Company Onboarding” runs only before “Company”, not before other decks in the org.
  - Docs/version synced.
- Verification: Build to be run now
- Author: Agent Mode (AI)
- Patch Release: v6.11.1 — Ordered Onboarding via Card.sortIndex
- Changes:
  - Card model: added sortIndex (Number, default null) + index { organizationId, parentTag, sortIndex }
  - Cards API: POST/PUT accept sortIndex, coerced to number or null
  - Cards UI: numeric "Order (optional)" input near parent selection
  - SwipeOnlyEngine: onboarding sessions now order by sortIndex asc, then createdAt asc (no shuffle)
  - Docs/version sync across README, ARCHITECTURE, TASKLIST, ROADMAP, LEARNINGS, RELEASE_NOTES, WARP.md with ISO 8601 timestamps
- Verification: Running build now

# Update — 2025-09-10T08:57:47.000Z
- Author: Agent Mode (AI)

  - Cards UI: new "Onboarding" checkbox with help text and warning for non-parent/no-children
  - Play orchestration: auto-run onboarding segments before selected deck (client-side queue; shallow routing); skip selected deck’s parent when flagged
  - Analytics: onboarding_auto_start and onboarding_complete events
  - Docs & version sync across README, ARCHITECTURE, TASKLIST, LEARNINGS, ROADMAP, RELEASE_NOTES, WARP.md; ISO 8601 timestamps
- Verification: Build to be run now; deployment pending confirmation

# Update — 2025-09-08T09:31:56.000Z
- Author: Agent Mode (AI)
- Scope: Universal Perceptual Feedback (Web-Safe) — implementation + docs + version bump to v6.9.0
- Changes:
  - Added Web Audio tick fallback (lib/utils/audioTick.js) with user-gesture gating
  - Added cross-platform haptics helper (lib/utils/haptics.js) that prefers vibration and falls back to audio tick when enabled
  - Added subtle CSS micro-animations (.micro-bump) in public/styles/game.css (reduced-motion aware)
  - Wired Swipe-Only UI to trigger light (recognition) and success (completion) feedback; added touchstart feedback hook
  - Introduced feature flag NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AUDIO_TICK and per-user localStorage override 'narimato_audio_tick'
  - Updated README (perceptual feedback section), ARCHITECTURE (note), LEARNINGS (entry), RELEASE_NOTES (v6.9.0), TASKLIST (completed), ROADMAP (timestamp)
  - Bumped package.json to 6.9.0 and synchronized versions
- Notes: All timestamps use ISO 8601 with milliseconds (UTC). No new dependencies.

# Plan — 2025-09-08T09:41:42.000Z
- Author: Agent Mode (AI)
- Title: Universal Perceptual Feedback Rollout Plan (v6.9.0)
- Objective: Make perceptual feedback available on any device/browser via native vibration (where supported), optional audio tick fallback, and micro-animations, governed by feature flags and accessibility preferences.
- Scope: Web app only; no native wrappers; no new dependencies; respects `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.
- Phases & Steps:
  1) Development Verification (Today)
     - Enable locally: localStorage.setItem('narimato_audio_tick','1')
     - Manual checks: Chrome (desktop), iOS Safari, Android Chrome
     - Verify: tick only after user gesture; reduced-motion suppresses feedback; no console errors
  2) Staging Enablement (2025-09-08T17:00:00.000Z)
     - Set env: NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AUDIO_TICK=true (staging)
     - Manual smoke on target devices; confirm no regressions
  3) Production Rollout (2025-09-09T12:00:00.000Z)
     - Set env: NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AUDIO_TICK=true (production)
     - Announce enablement and user override instructions
  4) Post-Deploy Verification (2025-09-10T12:00:00.000Z)
     - Manual checks on representative devices
     - If issues: rollback by setting env to false; advise users to clear local override
- Governance & Controls:
  - Feature flag: NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AUDIO_TICK (default off)
  - User override: localStorage 'narimato_audio_tick' = '1'|'0'
  - Accessibility: suppressed when reduced-motion is enabled
- Risk & Rollback:
  - Risk: perceived noise on some devices → keep volume/duration minimal; quick rollback via env flag
- Success Criteria:
  - No errors; perceptual feedback present on iOS/Android/desktop under user gesture
  - Reduced-motion users see no animation or tick
- Documentation:
  - README updated with enablement and override instructions
  - RELEASE_NOTES documents v6.9.0 scope
- Follow-ups (optional, future tasks):
  - Consider adding GA events for feedback (light/success) if needed
  - Consider org-level admin toggle in the future

# Update — 2025-09-09T07:27:00.000Z
- Author: Agent Mode (AI)
- Scope: Release v6.10.0 — Version and documentation synchronization; commit and push to origin/main
- Actions:
  - Bumped package.json to 6.10.0; synchronized README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, TASKLIST.md, LEARNINGS.md, ROADMAP.md
  - Verified production build (Next.js) before commit
  - Recorded plan/update entries with ISO 8601 ms timestamps
- Next:
  - Commit and push to origin main with versioned message

# Plan — 2025-09-09T10:30:00.000Z
- Author: Agent Mode (AI)
- Title: Enable Cross-Device Swipe Gestures on Play Page (Reuse Shared Hook)
- Objective: Reuse the proven gesture logic from Swipe-Only and enable drag/swipe (touch, pointer/mouse, and two-finger trackpad) on the unified Play page when in swipe mode.
- Approach:
  - Extract generic gesture handlers (touch/pointer/wheel) into a reusable hook: lib/utils/useSwipeGestures.js (no new dependencies)
  - Use centralized thresholds from lib/constants/gestures.js and haptics from lib/utils/haptics.js; respect reduced motion; keep touch-action: pan-y
  - Integrate hook into pages/play.js (enabled only when currentCard exists and not in voting mode)
  - Refactor pages/swipe-only.js to consume the same hook to eliminate duplication
- Notes:
  - Preserve existing keyboard controls and analytics events
  - Gate swipes via in-flight ref to avoid duplicates; add subtle micro-bump animation on recognition
  - Documentation and version bump to follow once verified (target v6.11.0)
- Compliance:
  - Reuse Before Creation; ISO 8601 timestamps; No tests; No breadcrumbs; Atlas-only

# Plan — 2025-09-09T15:34:00.000Z
- Author: Agent Mode (AI)
- Title: New Play Mode — Onboarding (Right-Only Swipe)
- Objective: Provide an onboarding flow that presents informational cards and only allows swiping right (like/continue) to teach the swipe interaction.
- Approach:
  - Backend: Reuse SwipeOnlyEngine via a new onboarding adapter; flag sessions isOnboarding=true on SwipeOnlyPlay; coerce any left input to right server-side.
  - Dispatcher: Register onboarding in PlayDispatcher and route SwipeOnlyPlay sessions with isOnboarding to onboarding engine.
  - API: Extend /api/v1/play/start schema to accept mode='onboarding'.
  - Frontend: Add mode button in deck list; in Play swipe mode, hide the left (👎) button, filter gestures to right-only, ignore left arrow.
- Notes:
  - No new dependencies; respects reduced-motion; analytics preserved.
  - Results flow unchanged; onboarding sessions still complete and can show results if needed.
- Compliance:
  - Reuse Before Creation; ISO timestamps; No tests; No breadcrumbs; Atlas-only

# Plan — 2025-09-10T14:31:38.000Z
- Author: Agent Mode (AI)
- Title: Next.js Security Remediation (Vulnerabilities #30, #28, #26)
- Objective: Remove Moderate findings related to middleware redirect SSRF and Image Optimization API routes by upgrading Next.js and hardening configuration.
- Actions:
