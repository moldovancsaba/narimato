# WARP.DEV_AI_CONVERSATION

Plan: Implement Google Analytics 4 (GA4) integration across the Next.js Pages Router app with production-only loading, IP anonymization, and Consent Mode v2. Add SPA pageview tracking, instrument gameplay/result events, and update documentation and versioning per project rules.

Decisions:
- Single GA property across all orgs
- Production-only load (NODE_ENV=production)
- IP anonymization enabled on all hits
- Consent Mode v2 defaults to denied; expose `window.NARIMATO_setAnalyticsConsent(granted)` helper
- Custom events: `play_start`, `swipe_action`, `vote_cast`, `segment_end`, `play_complete`, `results_view`

Changes:
- Created `lib/analytics/ga.js` (helpers with production guards, consent helpers)
- Added `pages/_app.js` (loads gtag, initializes Consent Mode, tracks SPA pageviews)
- Instrumented `pages/play.js` and `pages/results.js` with custom events
- Updated package.json versions (5.5.1 → build verification → 5.6.0)
- Updated README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, TASKLIST.md, ROADMAP.md, LEARNINGS.md, RELEASE_NOTES.md (ISO 8601 timestamps)

CSP Guidance:
- script-src: https://www.googletagmanager.com https://www.google-analytics.com
- connect/img-src: https://www.google-analytics.com

Next steps:
- Add consent UI (cookie banner) wiring to `window.NARIMATO_setAnalyticsConsent`
- Configure Vercel Production env var: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-8RCT54Y6E7`
- Optional: BigQuery export for raw event analysis

# Update — 2025-09-06T14:20:04.000Z
- Implemented Vote-More mode (`vote_more`): orchestrates multiple Vote-Only segments across hierarchical families
- Backend: `lib/services/VoteMoreEngine.js`, dispatcher registration, API `mode` support, model `VoteMorePlay` used
- Frontend: mode selection button, start mapping, next handling, results label
- Docs/version: bumped to v5.7.0; updated README, ARCHITECTURE, TASKLIST, LEARNINGS, RELEASE_NOTES, ROADMAP
- Strategy: Reused VoteOnlyService to avoid duplication; aggregation mirrors Swipe-More for UI compatibility

- Actions:
  - Added .btn-success variant to design system

# Update — 2025-09-06T20:57:14.000Z
- Author: Agent Mode (AI)
- Minor Release: v6.3.0 — New Play Mode: Rank-Only
- Actions:
  - Added RankOnlyEngine (swipe-only → vote-only) reusing SwipeOnlyEngine and VoteOnlyService
  - Added RankOnlyPlay model and dispatcher registration; start API supports mode 'rank_only'
  - UI deck selection includes Rank-Only; results label updated; swipe completion triggers voting with requiresVoting
- Verification: Build successful (Next.js)
- Actions:
  - Added Card.isPlayable (default true) to control deck exposure
  - API: POST/PUT for cards accept and update isPlayable
  - UI: Cards editor checkbox "Playable (public)"; Play/Rankings deck lists filter hidden decks; includeHidden=true shows all
- Notes: Hidden decks can still be played directly by URL (no change to /api/v1/play/start behavior)
- Verification: Build successful (Next.js)
- Actions:
  - Updated version to 6.0.0 in package.json and across all docs
  - WARP.md corrected to Pages Router structure, file paths, and stack (JavaScript, custom CSS)
  - README updated: version badge, current version, Quickstart path, vote_more added to mode lists
  - docs/API_REFERENCE.md updated: version header, last updated timestamp, vote_more support, legacy vote-only note
  - ARCHITECTURE.md header/timestamps updated; layout section aligned to Pages Router (`pages/_document.js`)
  - ROADMAP/TASKLIST/LEARNINGS timestamps and version updated; roadmap annotated as forward-looking only
- Timestamps: ISO 8601 with millisecond precision (UTC)
- Verification: build-only verification recommended; no dev run to avoid PATCH bump during major release
- Next: Commit and push to origin/main with a versioned message

# Update — 2025-09-07T08:45:15.000Z
- Author: Agent Mode (AI)
- Plan: Implement Rank-More mode (hierarchical decision-tree ranking)
- Details:
  - Multi-pass orchestration that runs Rank-Only per family; families processed in random order within each level
  - Branch exclusion: disliked children remove their entire branch from consideration
  - Output: flattened list only (parent followed by ranked descendants)
  - Reuse: SwipeOnlyEngine, RankOnlyEngine, VoteOnlyService, PlayDispatcher, unified /api/v1/play endpoints
- Next Steps:
  - Create RankMorePlay model and RankMoreEngine orchestrator
  - Register mode='rank_more' in PlayDispatcher; extend /api/v1/play/start to accept the mode
  - Ensure unified input/results support; frontend prompts for family-by-family flows (no breadcrumbs)
  - Update ROADMAP.md, TASKLIST.md and follow versioning rules
- Timestamps: ISO 8601 with millisecond precision (UTC)

# Update — 2025-09-07T11:34:45.000Z
- Author: Agent Mode (AI)
- Minor Release: v6.4.0 — New Play Mode: Rank-More
- Backend: Added RankMoreEngine and RankMorePlay; integrated with PlayDispatcher; extended start mode list; unified input/next/results; fixed hierarchical level progression logic
- Frontend: Added Rank More button; fixed swipe payload shape; added returnToSwipe handling to jump into new families; subtle “new-level” transition
- Docs: Updated README, API_REFERENCE, ARCHITECTURE, WARP.md, TASKLIST, ROADMAP, LEARNINGS, RELEASE_NOTES; all timestamps ISO 8601 with milliseconds
- Notes: Families are processed in random order within each level; branch exclusion for disliked children; results flattened only

# Update — 2025-09-07T12:10:54.000Z
- Author: Agent Mode (AI)
- Minor Release: v6.5.0 — Unified Canonical Documentation
- Actions:
  - Rewrote narimato_unified_documentation_UPDATED.md as the canonical engineering spec (replacing legacy session‑based content)
  - Propagated version bump to 6.5.0 across package.json, README.md (badge/current), ARCHITECTURE.md (Current Version, Last Updated), ROADMAP.md (Current Version, Last Updated), TASKLIST.md (Current Version, Date, Last Updated), RELEASE_NOTES.md (new entry v6.5.0), docs/API_REFERENCE.md (header + Last Updated + deprecation note)
  - Resolved API reference contradiction: clarified that specialized vote‑only endpoints under /api/v1/play/vote-only/* REMAIN for backward compatibility but are DEPRECATED internally; new work must use unified /api/v1/play/*
- Verification: Documentation‑only changes; build verification pending on request
- Notes: No code logic changes; aligns with WARP.md rules (no tests, no breadcrumbs, Atlas‑only, field constants) and ISO 8601 ms timestamps
