# NARIMATO — Unified Technical Documentation

Current Version: 7.2.0 (Doc & architecture alignment + multi-tenant DB routing)
Last Updated: 2026-05-23T00:00:00.000Z
Scope: This is the canonical engineering specification for NARIMATO. Other docs (README, ARCHITECTURE, API_REFERENCE, ROADMAP, TASKLIST, RELEASE_NOTES, LEARNINGS) are companion governance and navigation documents and must remain consistent with this file.

1. Project Overview
NARIMATO is an anonymous, Play‑based card ranking application. Users interact via swiping and/or voting, producing personal rankings (mode-specific engines; v1 vote uses VoteOnlyService) and global rankings (ELO on `Card.globalScore`) per organization. The system is multi‑tenant with master + per‑org MongoDB databases (ADR 002).

2. Technology Stack & Compliance
- Runtime: Node.js 20+
- Framework: Next.js 15.5.9 (Pages Router)
- Language: JavaScript
- Styling: Custom CSS (public/styles)
- Validation: zod
- Database: MongoDB (Atlas only). Localhost MongoDB is prohibited.
- Tests: PROHIBITED (MVP Factory rule)
- Navigation: Breadcrumbs are prohibited
- Timestamps: ISO 8601 with milliseconds in UTC (YYYY‑MM‑DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ)

3. Architecture & Directory Structure
- pages/ — Pages Router UI and API routes
  - api/v1/play/start.js, api/v1/play/[playId]/{input,next,results}.js (unified API)
  - api/v1/play/vote-only/* (specialized vote-only; back‑compat only; DEPRECATED)
  - api/cards.js, api/cards/[uuid].js, api/cards/rankings.js
- lib/ — Core application logic
  - constants/fieldNames.js (CRITICAL: field names)
  - services/play/PlayDispatcher.js (central dispatcher)
- services/SwipeOnlyEngine.js, VoteOnlyService.js, RankMoreEngine.js
  - Onboarding is integrated via SwipeOnlyEngine (isOnboarding flag, onboardingIndex) and a PlayDispatcher onboarding adapter
  - models/* (Play, RankMorePlay, Card, etc.)
- public/styles — CSS
- scripts — database/init/maintenance scripts
- docs — governance and API reference

4. Field Name Standardization (CRITICAL)
Use centralized constants from lib/constants/fieldNames.js. Do not hardcode field names.
- OrganizationUUID → organizationId
- SessionUUID → uuid
- PlayUUID → uuid
- CardUUID → uuid
- DeckUUID → deckTag
Rationale: Prevents drift (sessionId/cardId/uuid), ensures consistent DB operations and indexes.

5. Multi‑Tenant Database Architecture
- Master DB: Organization metadata
- Per‑Organization DBs: Isolated data per org
- Connections: Managed via buildOrgMongoUri() with strict validation
- Security: MongoDB Atlas only; injection‑safe URIs; no localhost

6. Play Modes & Unified API (Canonical)
Supported modes: onboarding, swipe_only, vote_only, swipe_more, vote_more, rank_only, rank_more
Canonical endpoints (Pages Router):
- POST /api/v1/play/start
- POST /api/v1/play/{playId}/input
- GET  /api/v1/play/{playId}/next
- GET  /api/v1/play/{playId}/results
Backward compatibility: Specialized vote-only endpoints under /api/v1/play/vote-only/* remain available but are DEPRECATED internally. New development must use the unified endpoints.

Onboarding (intro deck, v6.9.0):
- Purpose: instructional-only flow shown before the selected deck; not a ranking mode.
- UI: right-swipe Like (👍) only; Dislike (👎) is hidden; ArrowLeft ignored; ArrowRight advances.
- Client API: uses unified input payloads identical to swipe-only — POST /api/v1/play/{playId}/input with { action: 'swipe', payload: { cardId, direction: 'right' } }.
- Server behavior: index-based advancement (onboardingIndex), no swipes or rankings persisted; session marked completed at end.
- Start API: POST /api/v1/play/start supports mode: 'onboarding' and returns cards[] and currentCardId.
- Auto-run: client detects an onboarding parent deck for the selected deck and runs it first when present (naming patterns: <deck>_onboarding, <deck>-onboarding, or "<deck> onboarding"); requires ≥2 intro cards. After completion, original deck/mode resumes.

Ranking mechanics (personal): See `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` and issue #18 — v1 vote modes use VoteOnlyService; legacy binary search exists in `BinarySearchEngine` (not on unified dispatcher path). Global rankings: ELO on `Card` (`lib/utils/ranking.js`).

7. Cards & Organizations APIs
- `/api/cards`, `/api/cards/[uuid]`, `/api/cards/rankings` — tenant DB (`organizationId` required)
- `/api/organizations` — master DB registry
- Play session index on master: `PlaySessionIndex` maps `playId` → `organizationId`
Card fields: `name` (hashtag), `title`, `description`, `imageUrl`, `parentTag`, `hashtags`

8. Security, Rate Limiting, Vote Integrity & Caching
- Rate limiting: start 60/min, input/next/results 120/min per IP
- Vote integrity: server 2s dedupe (`VoteOnlyService`); client 100ms debounce (`pages/play.js`)
  - Client: 100ms debounce + UI state lock to prevent rapid clicks
  - Server: deduplicate identical votes within a 2s window
- Organization caching
  - Global in‑memory cache with 5‑minute TTL, concurrent request deduplication, safe invalidation
- Headers & policies
  - HTTPS with HSTS; CSP in production; no sensitive data in client storage

9. Organization‑Level Theming (not implemented — see docs/FUTURE.md)

10. Environment Management
Required env:
- MONGODB_URI (Atlas)
- ORGANIZATION_DB_URIS (optional JSON map)
Rules:
- Master uses MONGODB_URI; per‑org URIs via buildOrgMongoUri() or ORGANIZATION_DB_URIS
- Validate URIs; enforce Atlas‑only policy

11. Versioning & Documentation Protocols
- Before npm run dev: increment PATCH
- Before commit: increment MINOR (reset PATCH to 0) and update all docs
- Major: on explicit instruction only
- Update these files on changes: README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, TASKLIST.md, LEARNINGS.md, RELEASE_NOTES.md, ROADMAP.md
- Version must match across UI, package.json, docs

12. Troubleshooting (Known Issues & Fixes)
Onboarding input returns 400 (fixed in v6.9.0)
- Cause: client sent action: 'next' to unified input endpoint; dispatcher expects { action: 'swipe', payload: { cardId, direction } } for onboarding.
- Fix: send { action: 'swipe', payload: { cardId, direction: 'right' } } during onboarding; server advances by index without persisting.

Double voting (fixed in v4.4.0)
- Cause: rapid clicks + lack of server dedupe
- Fix: 100ms client debounce + 2s server dedupe

“Session results not found” (fixed in v4.4.0)
- Cause: mismatch between backend results shape and frontend expectations
- Fix: transform results (sessionInfo.deckTag; personalRanking mapping)

Organization loading on first visit/incognito (fixed in v4.4.0)
- Cause: hydration conflicts, race conditions
- Fix: 100ms delayed initial fetch, global cache (5m TTL) with dedup

Playable decks threshold
- Rule: require minimum 2 cards to expose playable categories and prevent single‑card sessions

13. Future Considerations (Salvageable from Legacy)
These are not current commitments; they are curated for future work and flagged as DEPRECATED where applicable if they reflect older approaches.
- Admin Panel & Analytics Dashboard
  - Real‑time session stats, ranking trends, funnels, performance metrics; bulk card ops with impact analysis
- Error Response Standards
  - Structured envelope with error codes (1xxx client, 2xxx auth, 3xxx business‑state, 4xxx resource, 5xxx system)
- Offline/PWA Strategy
  - Background sync queues for swipe/vote/session‑complete; cache‑first for assets, network‑first for rankings
- API Versioning Negotiation
  - Version header routing; deprecation timelines and migration guidance
- Monitoring & Alerting
  - Health checks, Prometheus‑style metrics, log aggregation with correlation IDs
- Platform Compatibility Matrix
  - Condensed matrix when guarantees become necessary
- Gesture/Haptics UX
  - Mobile haptics, thresholds, visual animation state mapping
- DB Migration Framework
  - Formal migrations with audit and rollback
- Security & RBAC
  - Admin auth hardening, rate‑limit policies, abuse mitigation playbook

Notes on Backward Compatibility
- Specialized vote‑only endpoints under /api/v1/play/vote-only/* are DEPRECATED internally and kept for backward compatibility. Migrate to unified /api/v1/play/* endpoints at the next convenient opportunity.

Policies Reinforced
- No tests (MVP Factory)
- No breadcrumbs
- Atlas‑only MongoDB connections
- Field name constants must be used everywhere (lib/constants/fieldNames.js)
- All timestamps ISO 8601 with milliseconds in UTC
