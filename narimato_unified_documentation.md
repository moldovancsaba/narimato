1. Project Overview
NARIMATO is an anonymous, Play‚Äëbased card ranking application. Users interact via swiping and/or voting, producing personal rankings (binary search O(log n) placement) and global rankings (ELO‚Äëbased) per organization. The system is multi‚Äëtenant and versioned.

2. Technology Stack & Compliance
- Runtime: Node.js 20+
- Framework: Next.js 15.4.4 (Pages Router)
- Language: JavaScript
- Styling: Custom CSS (public/styles)
- Animations: @react-spring/web, @use-gesture/react
- Validation: zod
- Database: MongoDB (Atlas only). Localhost MongoDB is prohibited.
- Tests: PROHIBITED (MVP Factory rule)
- Navigation: Breadcrumbs are prohibited
- Timestamps: ISO 8601 with milliseconds in UTC (YYYY‚ÄëMM‚ÄëDDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ)

3. Architecture & Directory Structure
- pages/ ‚Äî Pages Router UI and API routes
  - api/v1/play/start.js, api/v1/play/[playId]/{input,next,results}.js (unified API)
  - api/v1/play/vote-only/* (specialized vote-only; back‚Äëcompat only; DEPRECATED)
  - api/cards.js, api/cards/[uuid].js, api/cards/rankings.js
- lib/ ‚Äî Core application logic
  - constants/fieldNames.js (CRITICAL: field names)
  - services/play/PlayDispatcher.js (central dispatcher)
- services/SwipeOnlyEngine.js, VoteOnlyService.js, RankMoreEngine.js
  - Onboarding is integrated via SwipeOnlyEngine (isOnboarding flag, onboardingIndex) and a PlayDispatcher onboarding adapter
  - models/* (Play, RankMorePlay, Card, etc.)
- public/styles ‚Äî CSS
- scripts ‚Äî database/init/maintenance scripts
- docs ‚Äî governance and API reference

4. Field Name Standardization (CRITICAL)
Use centralized constants from lib/constants/fieldNames.js. Do not hardcode field names.
- OrganizationUUID ‚Üí organizationId
- SessionUUID ‚Üí uuid
- PlayUUID ‚Üí uuid
- CardUUID ‚Üí uuid
- DeckUUID ‚Üí deckTag
Rationale: Prevents drift (sessionId/cardId/uuid), ensures consistent DB operations and indexes.

5. Multi‚ÄëTenant Database Architecture
- Master DB: Organization metadata
- Per‚ÄëOrganization DBs: Isolated data per org
- Connections: Managed via buildOrgMongoUri() with strict validation
- Security: MongoDB Atlas only; injection‚Äësafe URIs; no localhost

6. Play Modes & Unified API (Canonical)
Supported modes: onboarding, swipe_only, vote_only, swipe_more, vote_more, rank_only, rank_more
Canonical endpoints (Pages Router):
- POST /api/v1/play/start
- POST /api/v1/play/{playId}/input
- GET  /api/v1/play/{playId}/next
- GET  /api/v1/play/{playId}/results
Backward compatibility: Specialized vote-only endpoints under /api/v1/play/vote-only/* remain available but are DEPRECATED internally. New development must use the unified endpoints.

Onboarding (intro deck, v6.9.0):
- Purpose: instructional-only flow shown before the selected deck; not a ranking mode.
- UI: right-swipe Like (üëç) only; Dislike (üëé) is hidden; ArrowLeft ignored; ArrowRight advances.
- Client API: uses unified input payloads identical to swipe-only ‚Äî POST /api/v1/play/{playId}/input with { action: 'swipe', payload: { cardId, direction: 'right' } }.
- Server behavior: index-based advancement (onboardingIndex), no swipes or rankings persisted; session marked completed at end.
- Start API: POST /api/v1/play/start supports mode: 'onboarding' and returns cards[] and currentCardId.
- Auto-run: client detects an onboarding parent deck for the selected deck and runs it first when present (naming patterns: <deck>_onboarding, <deck>-onboarding, or "<deck> onboarding"); requires ‚â•2 intro cards. After completion, original deck/mode resumes.

Ranking mechanics (personal): Binary search placement with accumulated bounds, O(log n) comparisons. Global rankings: ELO‚Äëbased aggregation.

7. Cards & Organizations APIs
- /api/cards ‚Äî list/create/update (Pages Router)
- /api/cards/[uuid] ‚Äî individual card management
- /api/cards/rankings ‚Äî rankings helpers
- /api/v1/admin/organizations ‚Äî administration
Card content conventions:
- Card.name is a hashtag (e.g., #SPORT). Prefer ‚Äúhashtags‚Äù over ‚Äútags‚Äù.
- Card.body: imageUrl (optional), textContent (optional), background { type, value, textColor }

8. Security, Rate Limiting, Vote Integrity & Caching
- Rate limiting: 100 requests/minute per IP (see middleware)
- Vote integrity: dual‚Äëlayer protection
  - Client: 100ms debounce + UI state lock to prevent rapid clicks
  - Server: deduplicate identical votes within a 2s window
- Organization caching
  - Global in‚Äëmemory cache with 5‚Äëminute TTL, concurrent request deduplication, safe invalidation
- Headers & policies
  - HTTPS with HSTS; CSP in production; no sensitive data in client storage

9. Organization‚ÄëLevel Theming
- Fields on Organization: theme.backgroundCSS, theme.googleFontURL, theme.emojiList, theme.iconList
- Injection: background CSS injected into a dedicated background layer; fonts loaded dynamically
- Security: sanitize and scope CSS to background layer; clean up on changes

10. Environment Management
Required env:
- MONGODB_URI (Atlas)
- ORGANIZATION_DB_URIS (optional JSON map)
Rules:
- Master uses MONGODB_URI; per‚Äëorg URIs via buildOrgMongoUri() or ORGANIZATION_DB_URIS
- Validate URIs; enforce Atlas‚Äëonly policy

11. Versioning & Documentation Protocols
- Before npm run dev: increment PATCH
- Before commit: increment MINOR (reset PATCH to 0) and update all docs
- Major: on explicit instruction only
- Update these files on changes: README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, TASKLIST.md, LEARNINGS.md, RELEASE_NOTES.md, ROADMAP.md
- Version must match across UI, package.json, docs

12. Troubleshooting (Known Issues & Fixes)
Onboarding input returns 400 (fixed in v6.9.0)
- Cause: client sent action: 'next' to unified input endpoint; dispatcher expects { action: 'swipe', payload: { cardId, direction } } for onboarding.
- Fix: send { action: 'swipe', payload: { cardId, direction: 'right' } } during onboarding; server advances by index without persisting.

Double voting (fixed in v4.4.0)
- Cause: rapid clicks + lack of server dedupe
- Fix: 100ms client debounce + 2s server dedupe

‚ÄúSession results not found‚Äù (fixed in v4.4.0)
- Cause: mismatch between backend results shape and frontend expectations
- Fix: transform results (sessionInfo.deckTag; personalRanking mapping)

Organization loading on first visit/incognito (fixed in v4.4.0)
- Cause: hydration conflicts, race conditions
- Fix: 100ms delayed initial fetch, global cache (5m TTL) with dedup

Playable decks threshold
- Rule: require minimum 2 cards to expose playable categories and prevent single‚Äëcard sessions

13. Future Considerations (Salvageable from Legacy)
These are not current commitments; they are curated for future work and flagged as DEPRECATED where applicable if they reflect older approaches.
- Admin Panel & Analytics Dashboard
  - Real‚Äëtime session stats, ranking trends, funnels, performance metrics; bulk card ops with impact analysis
- Error Response Standards
  - Structured envelope with error codes (1xxx client, 2xxx auth, 3xxx business‚Äëstate, 4xxx resource, 5xxx system)
- Offline/PWA Strategy
  - Background sync queues for swipe/vote/session‚Äëcomplete; cache‚Äëfirst for assets, network‚Äëfirst for rankings
- API Versioning Negotiation
  - Version header routing; deprecation timelines and migration guidance
- Monitoring & Alerting
  - Health checks, Prometheus‚Äëstyle metrics, log aggregation with correlation IDs
- Platform Compatibility Matrix
  - Condensed matrix when guarantees become necessary
- Gesture/Haptics UX
  - Mobile haptics, thresholds, visual animation state mapping
- DB Migration Framework
  - Formal migrations with audit and rollback
- Security & RBAC
  - Admin auth hardening, rate‚Äëlimit policies, abuse mitigation playbook

14. References
- README.md ‚Äî overview and links
- ARCHITECTURE.md ‚Äî visual flows, expanded patterns and components
- docs/API_REFERENCE.md ‚Äî canonical API request/response shapes

- TASKLIST.md ‚Äî live tasks; completed items moved to RELEASE_NOTES.md
- RELEASE_NOTES.md ‚Äî versioned change log
- LEARNINGS.md ‚Äî real issues faced and resolved (no placeholders)

Notes on Backward Compatibility
- Specialized vote‚Äëonly endpoints under /api/v1/play/vote-only/* are DEPRECATED internally and kept for backward compatibility. Migrate to unified /api/v1/play/* endpoints at the next convenient opportunity.

Policies Reinforced
- No tests (MVP Factory)
- No breadcrumbs
- Atlas‚Äëonly MongoDB connections
- Field name constants must be used everywhere (lib/constants/fieldNames.js)
- All timestamps ISO 8601 with milliseconds in UTC
