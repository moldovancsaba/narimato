## Completed Tasks

### Fix Organization Routing and Session Management Issues
- **Owner:** AI Agent
- **Expected Delivery Date:** 2025-08-14
- **Status:** Completed ✅
- **Completion Date:** 2025-08-14T15:20:00.000Z
- **Details:** Successfully resolved critical routing and session management bugs affecting user experience. Fixed organization slug mapping from API response to prevent navigation to `/organization/undefined`, standardized field naming consistency across play session creation APIs, removed problematic auto-completion logic that was immediately marking sessions as complete, harmonized results saving and retrieval to use consistent field names (sessionUUID), and updated field name constants to match actual model implementations. Manual testing confirmed: organization selection now navigates correctly, play sessions start in active/swiping state rather than completed state, and results retrieval works properly after session completion.

### Organization-Level Centralized Theme Management System
- **Owner:** AI Agent
- **Expected Delivery Date:** 2025-10-12
- **Status:** Completed ✅
- **Completion Date:** 2025-10-12T16:45:21.000Z

Key features include: Extended Organization schema with new theme fields (backgroundCSS, googleFontURL, emojiList, iconList), enhanced useOrganizationTheme hook for dynamic CSS injection and Google Fonts loading, full organization editor UI with live preview and syntax highlighting, animated background support with CSS editor, emoji and icon management with visual previews, and complete live theme preview system integrated in the organization editor. The system provides administrators with powerful tools to maintain consistent visual identity across all organization components while ensuring security and performance optimization.

### Fix Global Rankings API Hashtag Filtering
- **Owner:** AI Agent
- **Expected Delivery Date:** 2025-08-03
- **Status:** Completed ✅
- **Completion Date:** 2025-08-03T12:08:33.000Z
- **Details:** Successfully resolved critical issue where global rankings were not displaying for completed Play sessions. Fixed incorrect field mappings in global rankings API: corrected card filtering to use `hashtags` array instead of non-existent `tags` field, implemented proper parent-child hashtag relationship support with `$or` query logic, fixed card data mapping to derive type from `body.imageUrl` and use proper content structure. This resolves the "No rankings available for deck '#skills'" issue.

### Fix Play Session Completion State Bug
- **Owner:** AI Agent
- **Expected Delivery Date:** 2025-08-03
- **Status:** Completed ✅
- **Completion Date:** 2025-08-03T11:38:40.000Z
- **Details:** Successfully resolved critical bug where play sessions remained in 'active' status preventing completion. Updated Play model implementation, fixed completion detection logic, resolved all 404 errors on /api/v1/play/results endpoint, and improved session state management. Migrated from Session-based to Play-based architecture for better state consistency.

### Implement Minimum Card Threshold for Playable Cards
- **Owner:** AI Agent
- **Expected Delivery Date:** 2025-08-02
- **Status:** Completed ✅
- **Completion Date:** 2025-08-02T23:10:48.000Z
- **Details:** Successfully implemented a minimum card threshold rule to ensure only decks with sufficient cards for meaningful ranking experiences are displayed as playable options. Added DECK_RULES.MIN_CARDS_FOR_PLAYABLE = 2 constant, updated backend filtering logic in cardHierarchy.ts and cards API, added defensive checks in play start API, and enhanced user experience by preventing single-card deck sessions that provide no comparison opportunities. This resolves issues where users could start play sessions with only 1 card, which resulted in poor UX since no meaningful ranking/comparison was possible.

### Fix Deck System Migration to Multi-Card Level System
- **Owner:** AI Agent
- **Expected Delivery Date:** 2025-08-02
- **Status:** Completed ✅
- **Completion Date:** 2025-08-02T20:51:30.000Z
- **Details:** Successfully migrated the application from the deprecated deck-based system to the new multi-card level hierarchy system. Resolved 404 errors by updating `/api/v1/decks` calls to `/api/v1/cards?type=playable`, implemented proper data mapping from cards to deck-like UI structures, updated play session logic to use `cardName` instead of `deckTag`, and adapted both home page and rankings page to work with the new card hierarchy. All frontend components now properly display playable cards as categories without requiring the deprecated Deck model.

### Assess Models and Type Definitions
- **Owner:** AI Agent
- **Expected Delivery Date:** 2025-07-31
- **Status:** Completed ✅
- **Completion Date:** 2025-07-31T18:53:49.000Z
- **Details:** Successfully completed Step 9 - Comprehensive assessment of models and type definitions for completeness, correctness, and TypeScript coverage. Verified proper TypeScript usage across all models (Card, Session, DeckEntity, GlobalRanking, etc.), cross-cutting consistency between interfaces and schemas, and maximized type coverage. All models follow strict typing with proper interfaces, validation schemas, and field name constants for consistency.
