Resolved 404 errors by updating `/api/v1/decks` calls to `/api/v1/cards?type=playable`, implemented proper data mapping from cards to deck-like UI structures, updated play session logic to use `cardName` instead of `deckTag`, and adapted both home page and rankings page to work with the new card hierarchy. All frontend components now properly display playable cards as categories without requiring the deprecated Deck model.
