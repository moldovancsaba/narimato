## üî• Latest Features (v5.2.0)

### Enhanced Play Modes Architecture
- **Multiple Play Modes**: Optimized ranking approaches for different user preferences
- **Swipe-Only Mode**: Pure preference-based ranking using like/dislike mechanics

### Technical Implementation
- **Pluggable Engines**: `VoteOnlyService`, `SwipeOnlyEngine`, `SwipeMoreEngine` registered under a central dispatcher
- **Unified API**: Single, versioned surface for all plays:
  - `POST /api/v1/play/start` ‚Äî { organizationId, deckTag, mode: 'swipe_only' | 'vote_only' | 'swipe_more' | 'vote_more' }
  - `POST /api/v1/play/{playId}/input` ‚Äî { action: 'swipe' | 'vote', payload }

- **Mode Selection UI**: Deck selection with clear mode choices
- **Unified Interface**: Existing responsive game UI adapts to each mode

### Play Modes (Overview)
- Swipe-Only: Pure like/dislike; ranking = order of likes (first liked = rank 1)
- Vote-Only: UNRANKED/RANKED/PERSONAL algorithm with random opponent selection and strict pruning
- Swipe-More: Controller that runs multiple Swipe-Only segments (root family, then children of liked) and aggregates results
- Vote-More: Controller that runs multiple Vote-Only segments per family (root, then children of winners) and aggregates results

### Unified API Quickstart
- Start
  - POST /api/v1/play/start ‚Äî { organizationId, deckTag, mode: 'swipe_only' | 'vote_only' | 'swipe_more' | 'vote_more' }
- Input
  - Swipe: POST /api/v1/play/{playId}/input ‚Äî { action: 'swipe', payload: { cardId, direction } }
  - Vote: POST /api/v1/play/{playId}/input ‚Äî { action: 'vote', payload: { winner, loser } } (vote-only)
  - Swipe-More tie-break: { action: 'vote', payload: { cardA, cardB, winner } }
- Next
  - GET /api/v1/play/{playId}/next
- Results
  - GET /api/v1/play/{playId}/results

## üöÄ Quick Start

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load fonts. The card components use **Fira Code SemiBold (600)** for enhanced readability and modern aesthetic.

- Consent Mode v2 defaults to denied; toggle via `window.NARIMATO_setAnalyticsConsent(true|false)`
- IP anonymization is enabled on all hits
- SPA pageviews tracked on route change; initial pageview is sent after hydration
- Custom events implemented:
  - `play_start`, `swipe_action`, `vote_cast`, `segment_end`, `play_complete`, `results_view`

Environment variable:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-8RCT54Y6E7`

CSP note (if enabled later): allow scripts from `https://www.googletagmanager.com` and `https://www.google-analytics.com`, and connections/images to `https://www.google-analytics.com`.

## Deploy on Vercel
