## üî• Latest Features (v5.2.0)

### Enhanced Play Modes Architecture
- **Multiple Play Modes**: Optimized ranking approaches for different user preferences
- **Swipe-Only Mode**: Pure preference-based ranking using like/dislike mechanics
  - Simple first-liked-first-ranked algorithm
  - Clean swipe interface without voting complexity
  - Optimized for quick preference-based sorting
- **Swipe-More Mode**: Enhanced swiping with intelligent decision tree
  - Hierarchical card organization with smart level transitions
  - Combines swiping efficiency with voting precision
  - Optimized multi-level ranking system
- **Classic Mode**: Enhanced version of the original swipe-then-vote flow
  - Maintains existing complex hierarchical ranking system
  - Backward compatible with all existing sessions

### Technical Implementation
- **Pluggable Engines**: `VoteOnlyService`, `SwipeOnlyEngine`, `SwipeMoreEngine` registered under a central dispatcher
- **Unified API**: Single, versioned surface for all plays:
  - `POST /api/v1/play/start` ‚Äî { organizationId, deckTag, mode }
  - `POST /api/v1/play/{playId}/input` ‚Äî { action: 'swipe' | 'vote', payload }
  - `GET /api/v1/play/{playId}/next`
  - `GET /api/v1/play/{playId}/results`
- **Mode Selection UI**: Deck selection with clear mode choices
- **Unified Interface**: Existing responsive game UI adapts to each mode

### Play Modes (Overview)
- Swipe-Only: Pure like/dislike; ranking = order of likes (first liked = rank 1)
- Vote-Only: UNRANKED/RANKED/PERSONAL algorithm with random opponent selection and strict pruning
- Swipe-More: Controller that runs multiple Swipe-Only segments (root family, then children of liked) and aggregates results

### Unified API Quickstart
- Start
  - POST /api/v1/play/start ‚Äî { organizationId, deckTag, mode: 'swipe_only' | 'vote_only' | 'swipe_more' }
- Input
  - Swipe: POST /api/v1/play/{playId}/input ‚Äî { action: 'swipe', payload: { cardId, direction } }
  - Vote: POST /api/v1/play/{playId}/input ‚Äî { action: 'vote', payload: { winner, loser } } (vote-only)
  - Swipe-More tie-break: { action: 'vote', payload: { cardA, cardB, winner } }
- Next
  - GET /api/v1/play/{playId}/next
- Results
  - GET /api/v1/play/{playId}/results

## üî• Recent Improvements (v4.0.0)

### Major Database Schema Migration & Multi-Tenant Architecture
- **Schema Field Migration**: Successfully migrated from `cardId` to `cardUUID` field naming across the entire codebase
- **Robust Schema Migration**: Implemented automatic MongoDB index migration with old index cleanup and new index creation
- **Multi-Tenant Context Support**: Fixed organization UUID context propagation across all API endpoints
- **Global Rankings Restoration**: Resolved E11000 duplicate key errors that were blocking global ranking calculations
- **Complete Session Flow**: Fixed end-to-end game session flow from swiping to voting to final rankings

### Database and Index Management
- **Automatic Index Migration**: Drops old `cardId_1` indexes and creates new `cardUUID` indexes automatically
- **Collection Rebuilding**: Clears and rebuilds GlobalRanking collection when schema conflicts are detected
- **Error Prevention**: Eliminates duplicate key constraint errors during bulk write operations
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures consistent field naming and indexing across all database operations

### Multi-Tenant Architecture Fixes
- **Organization Context**: Fixed missing organization UUID headers in global ranking API calls
- **Tenant Isolation**: Proper data isolation between different organizations
- **Context Propagation**: Organization context properly flows through React components to API calls
- **Backend Validation**: Server-side validation of organization context for all requests

## üî• Previous Improvements (v3.6.3)

### Play-Based Architecture Implementation

## üöÄ Quick Start

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load fonts. The card components use **Fira Code SemiBold (600)** for enhanced readability and modern aesthetic.
