**Current Version:** 4.0.0 (Multi-Tenant Database Schema Migration)
**Date:** 2025-08-05
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-05T00:08:12.000Z

## Multi-Tenant Database Schema Migration (v4.0.0) - Critical Architecture

### Crisis Resolution: E11000 Duplicate Key Errors
1. **Critical Problem**: Global ranking calculations completely blocked by MongoDB error:
   ```
   E11000 duplicate key error collection: narimato.globalrankings index: cardId_1 dup key: { cardId: null }
   ```

2. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - **Field Name Mismatch**: Code used `cardUUID` but database had `cardId` index
   - **Schema Evolution**: Migration from `cardId` to `cardUUID` was incomplete
   - **Index Conflicts**: Old `cardId_1` unique index conflicted with new schema
   - **Bulk Write Failures**: All ranking calculations failing due to constraint violations

3. **Multi-Tenant Context Crisis**:
   - **Missing Headers**: Global ranking API calls missing `X-Organization-UUID` headers
   - **Context Propagation**: `useOrganization` context not integrated in ranking pages
   - **Backend Failures**: Organization validation failing on server-side
   - **Data Isolation**: Multi-tenant boundaries not properly enforced

### Solution Architecture: Robust Schema Migration
1. **Automatic Migration Logic**:
   ```typescript
   async function performSchemaMigration() {
     try {
       // Drop conflicting old index
       await GlobalRanking.collection.dropIndex('cardId_1');
       console.log('‚úÖ Old cardId index dropped successfully');
     } catch (error) {
       console.log('‚ÑπÔ∏è Note: Could not drop old index (may not exist)');
     }
     
     // Clear data to rebuild with new schema
     const deleteResult = await GlobalRanking.deleteMany({});
     console.log(`üîÑ Cleared ${deleteResult.deletedCount} existing ranking documents`);
     
     // Create new optimized index
     await GlobalRanking.collection.createIndex({ cardUUID: 1 }, { unique: true });
     console.log('‚úÖ New cardUUID index created successfully');
   }
   ```

2. **Organization Context Integration**:
   ```typescript
   // Frontend: Proper context propagation
   const { organization } = useOrganization();
   
   const response = await fetch('/api/v1/global-rankings', {
     headers: {
       'X-Organization-UUID': organization?.uuid || '',
       'Content-Type': 'application/json'
     }
   });
   
   // Backend: Context validation
   const organizationUuid = request.headers.get('X-Organization-UUID');
   if (!organizationUuid) {
     return new Response('Organization context required', { status: 400 });
   }
   ```

### Key Technical Learnings
1. **Schema Migration Strategy**:
   - **Detect Before Migrate**: Check for existing schema conflicts before operations
   - **Drop and Rebuild**: Sometimes safer than attempting complex field migrations
   - **Comprehensive Logging**: Essential for debugging complex migration issues
   - **Error Recovery**: Migration logic must handle partial failure states

2. **Multi-Tenant Context Handling**:
   - **Context Propagation**: Organization context must flow through entire React component tree
   - **Header Consistency**: All API calls must include tenant identification headers
   - **Server Validation**: Backend must validate and enforce tenant boundaries
   - **Error Messages**: Clear error messages when tenant context is missing or invalid

3. **Database Index Management**:
   - **Unique Constraints**: Be careful with unique indexes during schema evolution
   - **Index Names**: MongoDB auto-generates index names that can conflict during migrations
   - **Bulk Operations**: Field name mismatches cause bulk write failures
   - **Collection Rebuilding**: Sometimes necessary to clear and rebuild collections

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Comprehensive Field Mapping**:
   - Updated all database queries to use `cardUUID` consistently
   - Fixed API routes to return proper field names in responses
   - Aligned frontend expectations with backend field names
   - Ensured Mongoose models reflect actual schema structure

2. **Robust Error Handling**:
   - Migration logic handles cases where old indexes don't exist
   - Graceful degradation when organization context is missing
   - Comprehensive logging for all migration steps
   - Rollback capabilities for failed migrations

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Verified index creation and deletion operations
   - Tested organization context propagation across all API calls
   - Validated global ranking calculations with new schema
   - End-to-end testing of complete session flow

### Performance Impact Learnings
1. **Index Optimization**: New `cardUUID` indexes perform better than old `cardId` structure
2. **Bulk Operations**: Proper field naming eliminates constraint violations
3. **Memory Usage**: Collection rebuilding is memory-intensive but necessary
4. **Query Performance**: Organization-scoped queries perform well with proper indexing

### Future Migration Principles
1. **Schema Versioning**: Implement proper schema versioning for future changes
2. **Gradual Migration**: Consider blue-green deployment for major schema changes
3. **Data Preservation**: Always preserve existing data during migrations
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of migration logic before production deployment

## UUID Field Standardization (v3.7.1) - Dev / Architecture

### Problem Identification
1. **Inconsistent Field Naming**: Multiple variations used across codebase:
   - sessionId, session_id, SessionUUID, SESSION_FIELDS.ID
   - playId, playUuid, PlayUUID, PLAY_FIELDS.UUID
   - cardId, card_id, uuid, CardUUID, CARD_FIELDS.UUID
   - deckId, deckUuid, DeckUUID, DECK_FIELDS.UUID

2. **Maintenance Burden**: 
   - Field constant mappings were complex and error-prone
   - "Use X as Y" approach created cognitive overhead
   - Build failures when removing legacy field exports

3. **User Request**: "May we use uniform SessionUUID, PlayUUID, CardUUID and DeckUUID instead of those things you says 'use ---- as' is it possible to use everything as it is and not with 'aliases' or with 'lookalikes'?"

### Solution Implementation
1. **Standardized Field Constants**:
   ```typescript
   export const UUID_FIELDS = {
     SESSION: 'SessionUUID',
     PLAY: 'PlayUUID', 
     CARD: 'CardUUID',
     DECK: 'DeckUUID'
   } as const;
   ```

2. **Model Updates**:
   - Play model: Uses PlayUUID, SessionUUID, DeckUUID throughout
   - Session model: Uses SessionUUID for primary identifier
   - Updated all interfaces to use standardized field names

3. **Backward Compatibility Strategy**:
   - Added temporary exports for legacy field names
   - Prevented build failures during transition
   - Maintained functionality while enabling gradual migration

4. **Validation Functions**:
   - `validateSessionUUID()`, `validatePlayUUID()`, etc.
   - Uniform validation approach across all UUID types

### Key Learnings
1. **User-Centric Design**: When users request simplification, they're often identifying real complexity problems
2. **Gradual Migration**: Backward compatibility exports allow safe refactoring of large codebases
3. **Consistency Beats Cleverness**: Simple, uniform naming is more valuable than "clever" field mapping systems
4. **Documentation Immediately**: Architectural changes must be documented in ARCHITECTURE.md immediately

### Technical Implementation Notes
1. **Build Safety**: All changes verified with successful builds before proceeding
2. **Interface Alignment**: Model interfaces updated to match schema field names
3. **Import Organization**: Centralized field constants prevent import errors
4. **Type Safety**: Maintained TypeScript type safety throughout refactoring

### Future Cleanup
- Remove backward compatibility exports after frontend migration complete
- Update API documentation to reflect standardized field names
- Database field migrations (if needed for existing data)

### Performance Impact
- No performance degradation observed
- Build times remain consistent
- Import resolution improved with cleaner constant structure

## State Transitions  Edge Cases

### Concurrent Swipes
1. **Issue Identified**: Multiple rapid swipes could cause race conditions in state updates
2. **Resolution**: 
   - Implemented debounce (300ms) on swipe actions
   - Server-side validation ensures sequential processing
   - Duplicate swipes on same card are ignored

### Vote Phase Transitions
1. **Critical State Management**:
   - Right swipe triggers vote phase
   - First card automatically ranked and returns to swipe
   - Subsequent cards go through comparison with ranked cards
   - Smooth transition between vote and swipe phases
   - No "lost" cards during transitions

2. **Edge Cases Handled**:
   - Browser refresh during vote phase
   - Network interruption between swipe and vote
   - First card direct ranking scenario
   - Return to swipe after ranking complete
   - Duplicate vote submissions

### Swipe and Vote Component Insights
1. **Design Decision**:
   - Unified component structure for consistency in SwipeCard and VoteCard
   - Reuse of interface definitions for consistent data handling

2. **Technology Selection**:
   - Use @use-gesture/react for gesture handling to provide advanced interaction support
   - Leverage react-spring for smooth animations and visual feedback

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling strategies in SwipeCard component
   - Error states are visually distinguished to enhance user perception and recovery

4. **Animation Decisions**:
   - Carefully selected animation parameters (friction, tension) for optimal responsiveness
   - Utilized Framer Motion for declarative animation states in VoteCard

### Ranking Insertions
1. **Binary Search Optimization**:
   - Efficient card insertion using binary comparison
   - Maintains ranking integrity during insertions
   - Handles edge cases (top/bottom placements)

2. **Data Consistency**:
   - Atomic updates to prevent partial rankings
   - Validation of vote chain integrity
   - Prevention of circular references

### Session Recovery
1. **Robust State Persistence**:
   - Client-side state backup (localStorage)
   - Server-side session recovery
   - Graceful handling of incomplete states

2. **Recovery Scenarios**:
   - Browser/tab closure during active session
   - Network disconnection recovery

   - Implemented optimistic locking in session state updates
   - Addressed potential conflicts with robust retry strategies

2. **User Experience**:
   - Enhanced UI feedback loops to ensure clarity (e.g., hover effects on VoteCard)
   - Accessibility considerations integrated into keyboard event handling

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimized component re-renders with selective prop updates
   - Limited use of heavy operations in critical rendering paths

### UI/UX Component Design
1. **BaseCard Architecture**:
   - Unified component structure provides consistent card rendering across the application
   - Clean separation of concerns between content rendering and interactive overlays
   - Dynamic text scaling ensures optimal readability across different card sizes

2. **Typography Decisions**:
   - Fira Code SemiBold (600) chosen for professional, technical aesthetic
   - Monospace font provides consistent character spacing and improved readability
   - Weight optimization ensures proper contrast against gradient backgrounds

3. **Interface Simplification**:
   - Removed title overlays to eliminate visual clutter and improve focus
   - Clean design philosophy prioritizes content over decorative elements
   - Consistent user experience across swipe, vote, and results interfaces

### Dark Mode Implementation
1.  **Strategy Decision**:
    -   Chose a CSS custom properties approach with a `data-theme` attribute for maximum flexibility and maintainability.
    -   This allows for theme switching without a page reload and can be controlled via JavaScript.
2.  **Implementation Details**:
    -   Defined all theme-related values (colors, shadows) as CSS variables in `:root` for the light theme.
    -   Created a `[data-theme="dark"]` selector to override the default variables for dark mode.
    -   Enabled `darkMode: 'class'` in Tailwind CSS to use `dark:` variants in the codebase.

### Technical Insights
- **State Management**: Leveraged useState and useEffect hooks for fine-grained control over state and lifecycle operations.
- **Code Scalability**: Modularized components and common logic for future growth and maintenance ease.
- **Component Architecture**: BaseCard serves as a universal foundation, reducing code duplication and ensuring design consistency.

## Critical Session Completion Issues (v3.0.0)

### Last Voted Card Missing from Rankings
1. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Binary search algorithm had edge cases where final card insertion was incomplete
   - Search space collapse detection was not properly triggering card insertion
   - Accumulated bounds calculation needed to consider all previous votes, not just current comparison

2. **Solution Implementation**:
   - Enhanced `calculateAccumulatedSearchBounds()` function to process entire vote history
   - Improved position determination logic when search space becomes empty (bounds.start >= bounds.end)
   - Added comprehensive logging to track bounds calculation and card insertion

3. **Key Learning**: **Binary search algorithms require careful handling of edge cases where the search space collapses to a single position**

### "Loading Session..." Infinite State on Left Swipe
1. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Frontend was not properly handling `sessionCompleted` flag from swipe API responses
   - Session completion detection relied only on client-side deck exhaustion check
   - Backend correctly detected exhaustion and set completion flag, but frontend ignored it

2. **Solution Implementation**:
   - Added proper `sessionCompleted` flag handling in frontend swipe response processing
   - Prioritized session completion over other response flags (requiresVoting, etc.)
   - Implemented immediate redirect to results page when completion detected

3. **Key Learning**: **Always handle all API response flags in priority order - session completion should take precedence over other state changes**

### Last Right-Swiped Card Bypassing Vote Process
1. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Deck exhaustion check occurred before voting requirements were evaluated
   - Session completion was happening immediately even when card needed voting
   - Order of operations in swipe endpoint was incorrect for final card scenarios

2. **Solution Implementation**:
   - Reordered swipe endpoint logic to check voting requirements before session completion
   - Added conditional completion logic: immediate for left swipes, deferred for right swipes requiring votes
   - Enhanced logging to track deck exhaustion decisions and voting requirements

3. **Key Learning**: **Order of operations matters critically in state management - evaluate all requirements before making final state transitions**

### Binary Search Bounds Calculation Enhancement
1. **Technical Implementation**:
   ```typescript
   // Enhanced bounds calculation processes all votes for target card
   function calculateAccumulatedSearchBounds(targetCardId, ranking, votes) {
     let searchStart = 0;
     let searchEnd = ranking.length;
     
     // Process ALL votes involving this card to accumulate constraints
     for (const vote of votes) {
       if (vote.cardA === targetCardId || vote.cardB === targetCardId) {
         // Determine comparison card and its position
         const comparedCardId = vote.cardA === targetCardId ? vote.cardB : vote.cardA;
         const comparedIndex = ranking.indexOf(comparedCardId);
         
         if (vote.winner === targetCardId) {
           // Target won: ranks higher, narrow upper bound
           searchEnd = Math.min(searchEnd, comparedIndex);
         } else {
           // Target lost: ranks lower, narrow lower bound  
           searchStart = Math.max(searchStart, comparedIndex + 1);
         }
       }
     }
     
     return { start: searchStart, end: searchEnd };
   }
   ```

2. **Key Learning**: **Accumulated constraints from all previous decisions provide more accurate positioning than individual comparisons**

### Session Completion Flow Architecture
1. **Improved State Machine Logic**:
   - **Left Swipe + Deck Exhaustion**: Immediate session completion
   - **Right Swipe + Deck Exhaustion + No Votes Needed**: Immediate completion (first card scenario)
   - **Right Swipe + Deck Exhaustion + Votes Needed**: Defer completion until voting finished

2. **Frontend-Backend Communication**:
   - Backend provides clear completion signals via `sessionCompleted` flag
   - Frontend respects completion signals regardless of other state indicators
   - Comprehensive logging ensures troubleshooting visibility

3. **Key Learning**: **Complex state machines require clear separation of concerns and explicit communication protocols between layers**

### Debugging and Logging Strategy
1. **Comprehensive Logging Implementation**:
   - Added emoji-prefixed logs for easy visual scanning (üéä, üó≥Ô∏è, üìä, etc.)
   - Included card ID truncation for readable logs without full UUIDs
   - Captured state transitions with before/after snapshots
   - Logged both successful operations and error conditions

2. **Key Learning**: **Effective logging with visual markers and structured data significantly accelerates debugging complex state management issues**

### ELO Rating System Implementation
1. **Strategic Decision**:
   - Replaced total score with ELO rating as the primary global ranking metric
   - ELO provides more accurate skill-based comparisons than simple win counts
   - Maintains fairness across different numbers of games played

2. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Default ELO rating: 1000 for new cards
   - K-factor: 32 for appropriate rating volatility
   - Expected score calculation: `1 / (1 + 10^((ratingB - ratingA) / 400))`
   - Rating update: `newRating = currentRating + K * (actualScore - expectedScore)`

3. **Key Learning**: **ELO rating system provides more meaningful global rankings than total score, especially when cards have different numbers of appearances**

## Play-Based Architecture Migration (v3.6.3)

### Deck to Play Model Transition
1. **Architectural Decision**:
   - Migrated from static deck-based Sessions to dynamic Play-based sessions
   - Replaced fixed deck structures with hashtag-based card selection
   - Implemented real-time card fetching based on user-selected deck tags
   - Enhanced state management through Play model lifecycle

2. **Key Implementation Insights**:
   - Play model provides better session isolation and state consistency
   - Dynamic card selection allows for more flexible content organization
   - Hashtag hierarchy enables multi-level card categorization without rigid structures
   - Session completion logic simplified through Play-centric workflow

3. **Technical Benefits**:
   - Eliminated 404 errors from deprecated `/api/v1/decks` endpoints
   - Improved API consistency with Play-focused endpoints (`/api/v1/play/start`, `/api/v1/play/results`)
   - Enhanced scalability through dynamic content loading
   - Better separation of concerns between card management and session logic

### Hashtag Hierarchy System Implementation
1. **Design Philosophy**:
   - Parent-child relationships enable natural card organization
   - Tags serve as both categorization and playability markers
   - Minimum card threshold ensures meaningful ranking experiences
   - Dynamic deck generation replaces static deck management

2. **Technical Implementation Learnings**:
   - Card hierarchy validation prevents circular dependencies
   - Playable cards filtering based on DECK_RULES.MIN_CARDS_FOR_PLAYABLE = 2
   - Efficient querying through hashtag indexing
   - Real-time category count updates enhance user experience

3. **Key Learning**: **Hashtag-based hierarchies provide more flexible content organization than rigid deck structures while maintaining playability rules**

### Session Completion Bug Resolution
1. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Play sessions stuck in 'active' status due to incomplete state transitions
   - Results endpoint 404 errors from outdated API structure
   - Session completion detection failing on final card processing
   - State machine inconsistencies between frontend and backend

2. **Solution Implementation**:
   - Updated Play model with proper completion state management
   - Fixed API endpoint routing for results retrieval
   - Enhanced completion detection logic for edge cases
   - Synchronized frontend-backend state transitions

3. **Key Learning**: **Play-based architecture provides cleaner session lifecycle management than deck-based sessions, especially for completion state handling**

### Card Rendering Standardization
1. **Implementation Decision**:
   - Unified all card displays to use `body.imageUrl` for media rendering
   - Removed inconsistent image source handling across components
   - Standardized card preview and display logic
   - Enhanced BaseCard component for consistent rendering

2. **Benefits Realized**:
   - Eliminated rendering inconsistencies between card editors and displays
   - Simplified media handling logic across all components
   - Improved maintainability through single source of truth for card images
   - Enhanced user experience with consistent visual presentation

3. **Key Learning**: **Standardizing media rendering through a single field (body.imageUrl) eliminates inconsistencies and simplifies component logic**

### Global Rankings API Fix
1. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Global rankings API was using incorrect field mappings for hashtag filtering
   - Card filtering logic was looking for non-existent `tags` field instead of `hashtags` array
   - Card data mapping was using non-existent `type` and `content` fields from Card model
   - Missing support for parent-child hashtag relationships in query logic

2. **Solution Implementation**:
   - Fixed card filtering to use proper `$or` query with `name` and `hashtags` fields
   - Implemented support for both parent cards (by name) and child cards (by hashtag reference)
   - Corrected card type derivation from `body.imageUrl` presence (media vs text)
   - Fixed content mapping to use proper `body.textContent` and `body.imageUrl` structure

3. **Technical Details**:
   ```javascript
   // Fixed filtering logic
   cardFilter = { 
     ...cardFilter, 
     $or: [
       { name: deckTag }, // Parent card matches
       { hashtags: deckTag } // Child card has hashtag reference
     ]
   };
   
   // Fixed data mapping
   {
     type: card.body?.imageUrl ? 'media' : 'text',
     content: {
       text: card.body?.textContent,
       mediaUrl: card.body?.imageUrl
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Key Learning**: **API endpoints must align with actual data model schemas, especially when using dynamic hashtag hierarchies - field mappings and query logic must account for both parent-child relationships and proper data structure**

## Webpack Build System Issues (v3.7.1)

### Webpack Chunk Loading Failures
1. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Missing webpack chunks (`8548.js`, `4985.js`) causing 500 errors on critical pages like `/vote`
   - Corrupted `.next` build cache causing `routes-manifest.json` not found errors
   - Cache corruption warnings from PackFileCacheStrategy preventing proper chunk loading
   - Custom webpack chunk splitting configuration in `next.config.js` causing unstable builds

2. **Solution Implementation**:
   - Complete purge of corrupted build artifacts (`.next`, `node_modules`, `package-lock.json`)
   - NPM cache cleanup with `--force` flag to remove all cached dependencies
   - Fresh dependency reinstallation to rebuild clean package resolution tree
   - Comprehensive rebuild process to regenerate all webpack chunks and manifests

3. **Technical Details**:
   ```bash
   # Critical cleanup sequence
   rm -rf .next node_modules package-lock.json
   npm cache clean --force
   npm ci
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Key Learning**: **Webpack chunk loading issues often stem from cache corruption - complete environment reset is more reliable than selective cache clearing, especially with complex chunk splitting configurations**

### Next.js Configuration Optimization
1. **Configuration Review Process**:
   - Audited custom webpack overrides in `next.config.js` for stability issues
   - Reviewed chunk splitting, SSR, and static export settings for conflicts
   - Commented all critical customizations with functional and strategic justifications
   - Ensured all build configurations align with established architectural expectations

2. **Build Process Stabilization**:
   - Verified routes manifest generation and proper population
   - Confirmed webpack chunk creation without missing module errors
   - Tested development server stability with hot reload functionality
   - Validated production build consistency with development environment

3. **Key Learning**: **Complex webpack configurations require careful validation - custom chunk splitting and caching strategies can introduce instability that requires complete environment reset to resolve**

## Implementation Details

### State Machine Implementation
```typescript
type SessionState = 
  | 'CREATED'
  | 'SWIPING'
  | 'VOTING'
  | 'COMPARING'
  | 'COMPLETE';

type StateTransition = {
  from: SessionState;
  to: SessionState;
  trigger: string;
  validation: () => boolean;
};

const stateTransitions: StateTransition[] = [
  {
    from: 'CREATED',
    to: 'SWIPING',
    trigger: 'DECK_READY',
    validation: () => deckIsValid()
  },
  {
    from: 'SWIPING',
    to: 'VOTING',
    trigger: 'RIGHT_SWIPE',
    validation: () => cardIsValid()
  },
  {
    from: 'VOTING',
    to: 'SWIPING',
    trigger: 'FIRST_CARD_RANKED',
    validation: () => noRankedCardsExist()
  },
  {
    from: 'VOTING',
    to: 'COMPARING',
    trigger: 'HAS_RANKED_CARDS',
    validation: () => hasRankedCards()
  },
  {
    from: 'COMPARING',
    to: 'COMPARING',
    trigger: 'MORE_COMPARISONS',
    validation: () => needsMoreComparisons()
  },
  {
    from: 'COMPARING',
    to: 'SWIPING',
    trigger: 'COMPARISONS_COMPLETE',
    validation: () => rankingComplete()
  },
  {
    from: 'SWIPING',
    to: 'COMPLETE',
    trigger: 'NO_MORE_CARDS',
    validation: () => allCardsProcessed()
  }
];
```

### Recovery Protocol
```typescript
interface RecoveryState {
  sessionId: string;
  lastKnownState: SessionState;
  timestamp: string; // ISO8601
  ranking: string[]; // Card UUIDs
  remainingCards: string[]; // Unprocessed cards
}

async function recoverSession(sessionId: string): Promise<void> {
  // 1. Load recovery state
  const state = await loadRecoveryState(sessionId);
  
  // 2. Validate state integrity
  if (!isStateValid(state)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid recovery state');
  }
  
  // 3. Rebuild session context
  await rebuildSessionContext(state);
  
  // 4. Resume from last known good state
  await resumeSession(state.lastKnownState);
}
